## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
* w3schools.com

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Time was the most challenging part in this application. I found this internship opportunity on March 30, and immediately began applying. 
I had to rearrange my schedule to make time between schoolwork for this application. Because I only had two days to apply, many of the 
features that I wanted to implement could not be implemented due to time constraints. Once I implemented the most basic functionality, I had to select 
which of the optional features I wanted to work on. I started off with most of the optional features that could easily be implemented in one sit-down . 
After I finished these features, i began on the Reflection Questions and the Interview. Any time I had left after completing these would be dedicated to polishing my game.
Even though I was pressed for time, I spent a little extra time each day working and finished my application! 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
Web Development seems like a very hands on and interesting field to work in! I'm interested to see what we will actually work with in our SITE internship
and if it is close to what real web developers do out in industry. Since this prework interacts with only basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, will we be working 
with bootstrap/frameworks later? In addition, do web developers only use frameworks and vanilla JS/CSS/HTML? How in detail do web develepors need to know about ux design? I go was wondering how much the SITE internship will cover 
in regards to the design proccess, which i feel like is not covered enough. As good design is important to create a beautiful app, I believe cs classes dont really touch on this topic enough. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
First, I would implement a couple more optional features such as implementing a limited amount of time for each guess, adding specific sounds per button, and much more
Next, I would revamp my ui to have a more consistent and clean look. I love flat and minimalistic design, so I would change my color palette to more pleasing colors and the 
font to match. Next, I would try to implement a scoreboard, where players can compete with their friends, with the ability to share scores and keep track of their progress.
Finally, I would push this to a domain and have it publicly avaliable for play. This would entail having a online database to store player progress, which would take more than a couple hours to implement.
