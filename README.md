## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

* stackoverflow.com

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
```markdown
Time was the most challenging part in this application. I found this internship opportunity on March 30, and immediately
began applying. I had to rearrange my schedule to make time between schoolwork for this application. Because I only had
two days to apply, many of the features that I wanted to implement could not be implemented due to time constraints.
Once I coded the most basic functionality, I had to select which of the optional features I wanted to work on.
I started off with most of the optional features that could easily be implemented in one sit-down such as improving
the UI, changing sound tones, and customizing the buttons. After I finished these features, I worked on the other parts
of the application. Any time I had left after completing these would be dedicated to polishing my game. Even though I was
pressed for time, I made sure to use any possible bit of spare time to create a polished application! 
```

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
```markdown
Web Development seems like a very interesting hands-on field to work in! I'm interested to see what we will 
actually work with in our SITE internship and if it is representative of what real web developers do in the industry. 
Since our prework assignment interacts with only basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, my question is will we be working with 
bootstrap/frameworks later? In addition, do most web developers only use frameworks without using vanilla JS/CSS/HTML? 
My last question is how in detail do web develepors need to know about ux design? I was wondering how much the SITE 
internship will cover in regards to the design proccess, which I feel like is not covered enough. As good design is 
important to create a beautiful application, I believe CS classes dont really touch on this topic enough.
```

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
```markdown
First, I would implement a couple more optional features such as implementing a limited amount of time for each 
guess, adding specific sounds/audio files per button, and much more. One of my fancier ideas was to have a random 
duration per sound, and that players would have to replicate the duration of the sound. For example, the first tone 
is around 1/4 second while the second tone to guess is around 1/2 of a second. Next, I would revamp my UI to have a 
more consistent and clean look by adding ew fonts to match my tropical vibe and including other images like a sun and 
palm trees.I love flat and minimalistic design, so I would add consistent vector icons that match each other and stay 
on theme. Next, I would try to implement a scoreboard, where players can compete with their friends, with the ability 
to share scores and keep track of their progress. Finally, I would push this to a domain and have it publicly avaliable 
for play. This would entail having a online database to store player progress. All these features would take probably 
more than a couples days to implement.
