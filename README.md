**Ocean Tones** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Brian Liu**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

* w3schools.com
* stackoverflow.com

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
```markdown
One challenge that I encountered while creating this submission was time management. I have a habit of focusing solely on 
one task for hours on end. Sometimes, work that I have planned gets pushed back a day or two because I put all
my energy into one specific task. During the application process, I felt that I always had schoolwork that I would 
prioritize over this submission. When I did dedicate a block of time, I would get stuck on a little bug which would 
sometimes take me up to an hour to debug. One example was when I was styling with css. No matter what I did, I couldn't 
get flexbox to align my buckets (buttons) vertically. I stared at it for over 30 minutes with no avail. I realized 
that I was never going to get anything done at this pace; something needed to change.  After taking a break, I quickly 
realized what was wrong. I didn'tcreate my divs correctly, so flex styling wasn't being correctly applied. 
I resolved to set some time aside each day to code a little to see if I could fix my bugs. 
I spent anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour each day, slowly but surely improving my game and my responses. 
Looking back, I realized that I didn't always have to do all my work in one sitting. Working a little bit each 
day actually proved to be more efficient than sitting down and spending hours! Taking breaks and working on other 
projects and assignments helped clear my mind and reset. This would often help me see the small bugs that were quite 
literally right in front of me. 
```

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
```markdown
Web Development seems like an interesting hands-on field to work in! I'm interested to see what we will 
actually work with in the SITE internship and if it is representative of what real web developers do in the industry. 
Since our prework assignment interacts with only basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, my question is; will we be working with 
bootstrap/frameworks later on in the internship? In addition, do most web developers only use frameworks without using 
vanilla JS/CSS/HTML? My last question is how in detail do web develepors need to know about ux design? I was wondering 
how much the SITE internship will cover in regards to the design proccess, which I feel like is not covered enough. 
As good design is important to create a beautiful application, I believe CS classes don't really touch on this topic enough.
```

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
```markdown
First, I would implement a couple more optional features such as programming a limited amount of time for each 
guess, adding specific sounds/audio per button, and adding the option of 3 guesses before the game ends. One of my 
fancier ideas was to have a random tone duration per sound and have players replicate the duration of the tone. 
For example, the first tone is around 1/4 second while the second tone is around 1 second. The player 
would then have to perform a short press on the first tone and a longer press on the second tone. Next, I would revamp 
my UI to have a more consistent and clean look by adding a font to match my beach theme and including more images as 
background objects like a sun and palm trees. I love flat and minimalistic design, so I would add consistent vector 
icons that match each other and stay on theme. Next, I would try to implement a scoreboard, where players can compete 
with their friends, with the ability to share scores and keep track of their progress. Finally, I would push this to 
a domain and have it publicly avaliable for play. This would entail having a online database to store player progress. 
All these features would take probably more than a couples days to implement.
